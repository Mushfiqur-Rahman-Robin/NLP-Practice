Hey! Mushfiqur finally focused on learning NLP in detail! It's time to clarify all the basic concepts of NLP. I will love to learn countvectorizer, tf-idf, bag-of-words, stemming, lemmatization, etc. and their core concepts. I am also targetting to learn advanced NLP concepts like RNN, GRU, LSTM, Encoder-Decoder, Attention models, Transformers, etc. I already have some knowledge on ML and DL regarding Computer vision, and it's time to take it a level ahead. SO, let's get started!
